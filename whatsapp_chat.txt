6/17/21, 7:04 PM - SAP da Dharithri: This year on June 18, Goa Prism in association with Sethu is celebrating ‘Autistic Pride Day’ to build a more inclusive society that strongly believes, “Being Autistic means you aren't weird, but differently wired.”

People with autism have unique characteristics. Despite the inevitable challenges of their neurodiversity, another factor that they struggle with - is the attitude of society towards them. Hence, it is highly essential to spread awareness regarding Autism.

7/17/21, 9:35 AM - Rahul Sahya: Input:-Key[1...n],p[1...n],q[0...n]
STEP 1:
Select 0<=i&j<=n such that i-j=0,1,...,n
STEP 2:
Find W[i,j] for all the selected values of i,j where W[i,j]=W[i,j-1]+p[j]+q[j]
STEP 3:
Find C[i,j] also corresponding r[i,j] for all the selected value of i, j.Let k be a int such that i<k<=j, then
a) c[i,j]=(minimum of{c[i,k-1]+c[k,j]})+W[i,j]
b) r[i,j] is the value of k for which c[i,k-1]+c[k,j] is minimum 
STEP 4:
return  r[0,n]

8/13/21, 1:28 PM - SAP da Dharithri: As a nation, we celebrate August 15 every year by hoisting  the tricolor, taking great pleasure to greet all Indians in the country and abroad, celebrating with family and friends, listening to patriotic songs and remembering with gratitude all the freedom fighters and martyrs, whose sacrifices have led to the independence of our nation.

This year's 75th Independence Day celebration, we will be rather restrained. The reason is obvious, as the whole world confronts a deadly virus which has disrupted all our activities and changed everything since the pandemic! So, Incredible Goa has come up with a special event on the eve of Independence day on the topic of *"Pertinent issues faced in Modern India"*.

To join us to witness this virtual discussion on *14th Aug, 2021* from *5:00 to 6:00 PM*, with eminent panelists from sectors like Education, Tourism, Health and IT, and gain insights on futuristic views and far reaching impact, register now at:

12/26/21, 10:35 AM - Abhishek Pai Sahyadri: Greeting From Sahyadri MIC IIC ,
We are happy to inform you that we are hosting a talk on “Learning Industry Domain Knowledge for young Entrepreneurs and Innovators" by Manoj kumar Lal from TCS, India.
Abstract: Industry domain knowledge (e.g., banking, insurance, retail) which is equally important in producing quality software along with technology and soft skills, is not adequately exposed to our graduating students. One of the important reasons being, there are multiple Industry and their domain knowledge is vast. Knowledge Driven Development (KDD), an emerging knowledge management framework has come up with a scientific way of learning multiple domains using a common structure. It also links domain knowledge to software development. This has created an opportunity to seed industry domain knowledge in academia increasing the employability of students.

7/24/22, 10:12 AM - SAP da Dharithri: For your lab externals..

Before typing the program which you've got..just check whether you can successfully run "Hello world" program.
Once that gets executed, then you can  start typing your program in that same file.

Let a USB cable be in your bag(for the worst case)
7/24/22, 10:12 AM - SAP da Dharithri: And you all have to manage time..so when you have to simply wait for the emulator to get loaded or whatever it is...you can complete the writing part of  .xml code
7/24/22, 10:12 AM - SAP da Dharithri: If you get 1st program then you need to write .xml code (so without any option you have to learn)


So for other program's,you can write similar lines if invigilator asks you to write even .xml part.
And then you can correct those once after executing.

8/5/22, 1:02 PM - +91 96067 80002: Dear Students, 

Now we are in a very Important stage where we need to plan for your internships 


So start applying for online/offline internships .. 


Please note.. 

Don't apply internship on domain like

web application(html, css, php) n mobile app development...it  is not allowed
(Because already these things were there in academics) 


Try to apply for the domain which is not included in your academics (till now) 


You can do internship in domains like
* full stack development(other than html, php, css) 

*AI/ML
 *IOT
* networking
* data science
* image processing

Or any cs related domain which you are going to learn something new

Before starting your internship should submit the application form, 
Take approval of your mentor...


At the end you should give demo of your internship project n weekly wise task performed details... 


Based on this your internship is evaluated for 100 marks

If any queries contact Internship coordinators
(Mrs. Pooja N S, 
Mrs. suketha
Mrs. Namita) 


Thank you
8/5/22, 1:05 PM - +91 96067 80002: You can start applying for internships now, but we will be doing the internships after our 6th-semester external exams are over. It will be a one-month Internship. If you are going for a two-month internship then it should be an online internship.
8/5/22, 1:06 PM - +91 96067 80002: Before September 30th your internship should be complete.
8/5/22, 2:44 PM - +91 91104 32699: Thnks everyone ❤️

10/28/22, 4:09 PM - SAP da Dharithri: Hello everyone!

We all agree that there is no role in life more essential and more eternal than that of motherhood. 

But, have you ever wondered what the sad reality of motherhood is? Well, wistfully there are close to 100 to 130 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, in India! These mothers are losing their lives during child birth due to inadequate quality of service

So, here we are. A team of Engineering students with a vision to ease motherhood in India.

How can you contribute to our vision?
1) If you are a mother yourself, kindly take a moment to fill this form: https://forms.gle/hXY6cerei9SG2dxDA

12/6/22, 11:53 AM - SAP da Dharithri: Give some tips for those who wil be trying for Hashdin
12/6/22, 12:49 PM - Rahul Sahya: yeah sure.......
*)During pre placement talk at last they'll say we are looking for 3 things i.e. Coding, coding and coding
But what they are looking for is not amount of knowledge just the quality Basics bcz they are searching for fast learner who will be trained in the name of intership
*)Everyone knows the common question like OOPs etc etc and you will byheart google ans which is the biggest mistake
They are asking same question for everyone and you should prove u r monster through these questions
*)Most imp question in interview is tell me about yourself especially for Hashdin. Don't waste ur time by simply telling ur school address etc etc
Here you should give the question bank to interviewers of ur preparation. Direct them such a way that they should ask ur predicted questions
*)Never follow the suggestion given by seniors , selects like great Rahul D Poojari. Gain information but don't follow because all fingers are not same.
*Gain information and build your strategy*
12/6/22, 12:50 PM - Rahul Sahya: Speaking abt Hashdin 
Do some research on company before pre placement
Then there will two technical round 1st one 75% on DSA Both round begins with single question tell me about yourself
after 2 round Next HR round also called fitment round here you should be careful about your soft skill
*Don't freeze yourself to look cool*
Never agree that u did illegal practices during online assesment etc...
12/6/22, 12:55 PM - Rahul Sahya: This is wat they asked me
but for devops eng role they might concentrate on networking etc etc
12/6/22, 12:56 PM - Rahul Sahya: Homework 
write 1 min essay on ur project and tell me about yourself
12/6/22, 1:00 PM - Rahul Sahya: Hope thats enough for further suggestion or help contact The great Rahul
